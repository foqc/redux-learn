# Learn Redux

It is a React Redux application that consumes data from the BookAPI made on NodeJS. Users can log in, create, edit, delete and view books and their associated colors. 

Uses:
* React
* Redux
* React Router
* Redux Thunk middleware
* Custom JWT authentication system.

## Why Did I Build This?

This app was built for the purpose of learning about React and Redux, following the series of eight blog posts on building a simple React Redux application, written by Sophie DeBenedetto.
 
You can check out those posts [here](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/building-a-simple-crud-app-with-react-redux-part-1/#table-of-contents), and post on JWT auth with React [here](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/jwt-authentication-with-react-redux/). 

This application contains small variations with respect to the tutorials for example the version of react router 4 is used.
